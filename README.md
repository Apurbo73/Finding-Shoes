This C++ program processes multiple test cases, each involving two integers `a` and `b`, and performs a simple arithmetic comparison to output a result based on their relationship. For each pair, the program checks if `b` is exactly double `a` (i.e., `a * 2 == b`). If true, it outputs `b - a`, which simplifies to `a`. If `a` is greater than `b`, it outputs the difference between `a * 2` and `b`, suggesting some kind of balancing or adjustment logic. In all other cases — typically when `b` is greater than `a` but not exactly double — it simply outputs `a`. Overall, the program seems to be calculating a result based on how far apart the two values are, possibly aiming to make them equal through minimal operations.


## If -Else Conditon Basic:

In C++, the **if-else condition** is a control structure that allows the program to make decisions based on whether a specific condition is true or false. The `if` statement checks a condition, and if it's true, the associated block of code executes. If the condition is false, the program moves to the `else if` (if provided) to check another condition. This continues until a true condition is found or all conditions are false. If none of the conditions are true, the `else` block (if included) is executed as a default action. This structure is useful for handling multiple possible outcomes in a program, such as checking whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.
